            "This video discusses neural net layer concepts and activation functions. Hope you find it helpful! Takeaways from this video: - Basic introduction of Feedforward Neural Nets - Perceptron: It is a neuron with a single input, weight, and output . If the weighted sum is greater then some threshold, we say 1 else 0. If we push this concept, to several input we get a neural net. - Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU are typical activation functions. - Input, Hidden and Output layers in a Neural Net. - Inback: inputs and weights are fed into a matrix and transformed via activation func. - Output is yielded by x*W+b. - Backpropagation, DelW & Delb, yielding gradients, compute the error. Multiply each weight times the error for each sample, Compute Loss, continuous value. Non Gradient updates using derivative of tabular funcs lead to gradient descent, and momentum. SGD — thinking of weight changes from iterative x update. Don’t forget look for more niwlab’s videos, I am also creating my own video series for Deep Learning in Python!\n",
