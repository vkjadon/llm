These tokens can be words, characters, or subwords, making complex text understandable to computers. By dividing text into manageable pieces, tokenizers enable machines to process and analyze human language, powering various language-related applications like translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots. Essentially, tokenizers bridge the gap between human language and machine understanding.\n",

        "The subword-based tokenizer allows frequently used words to remain unsplit while breaking down infrequent words into meaningful subwords. Techniques such as SentencePiece, or WordPiece are commonly used for subword tokenization. These methods learn subword units from a given text corpus, identifying common prefixes, suffixes, and root words as subword tokens based on their frequency of occurrence. This approach offers the advantage of representing a broader range of words and adapting to the specific language patterns within a text corpus.\n",

For instance, 'Unhappiness' is split into 'un' and 'happiness,' both of which can appear as stand-alone subwords. When we combine these individual subwords, they form 'unhappiness,' which retains its meaningful context. This approach aids in maintaining the overall information and semantic meaning of words.\n",

        "In PyTorch, especially with the `torchtext` library, the tokenizer breaks down text from a data set into individual words or subwords, facilitating their conversion into numerical format. After tokenization, the vocab (vocabulary) maps these tokens to unique integers, allowing them to be fed into neural networks. This process is vital because deep learning models operate on numerical data and cannot process raw text directly. Thus, tokenization and vocabulary mapping serve as a bridge between human-readable text and machine-operable numerical data. Consider the dataset:\n"
